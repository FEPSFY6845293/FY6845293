     The Nyatapola and Bhairavnath temples were some of Nepalâ€™s historic monuments to survive the Gorkha earthquake in 2015. When looking further clever engineering techniques were 
     used to make the temples more resilient and sturdier. The first look was into walls and how they decrease in mass on every level in the temple creating a cone shape in destruction 
     which is hard to knock over. The foundations have a stepped plinth system that acts as a damper and a stiff base, so any soil displacement is negated. Finally, the roofs are built 
     on every floor to prevent weathering damage to the walls. On the other hand, rehabilitation and rebuilding have been put in place by replacing damaged walls or fixing torsional 
     drifted roofs with plans. These are one of many ways these national monuments stand upright through harsh times.

     The Gorkha earthquake was one of the largest to hit Nepal due to its 7.6 magnitude hitting the south border of China (Bhagat, et al. 2017). The earthquake emerged when the Indian plate 
     submerged the Eurasian plate, affecting 57 out of the 75 districts (Bhagat, et al. 2017). Due to this devastating earthquake, many monuments and temples were damaged 743 across Nepal 
     (Shilpakar, Prajapati, Kawan, et al., 2019). Kathmandu and Bhaktapur were the main places affected the heaviest, leading to the highest damage in their historical heritage sites 
     (Shilpakar, Prajapati, Kawan, et al., 2019). 2900 historical buildings were affected with 133 collapsed, and 95 partially collapsed (Shilpakar, Prajapati, Kawan, et al., 2019). 
     This paper investigates what temples like the Nyatapola and Bhairavnath have structurally and what caused damage to them.
